# HW-4
This map used the information from HW 3 as its base. To learn more about leaflets and cool attributes, I played around and added Icons to local cafes that sell pies and pie making ingredients. I kept grocery store details because I want viewers to see if they are closer to a pie shop or a store where they can purchase baking ingredients.
